# Interactive-Letter-Dragging-Application-using-Hand-Gestures
Overview:
This project is an innovative educational tool designed for children aged 13 and below. It
leverages computer vision and hand tracking technologies to create an interactive experience
where users can drag and arrange letters on the screen using only hand gestures. The
application is built using Python with the help of libraries such as OpenCV, MediaPipe, and
PyAutoGUI. This project aims to make learning fun and engaging by allowing kids to interact
with the digital environment in a natural and intuitive way.
Key Features:
1. Hand Tracking and Gesture Recognition:
o The application uses MediaPipe to detect and track hand landmarks in real-time via
the webcam.
o Hand gestures, specifically the positions of the index finger and thumb, are used to
interact with letters on the screen.

2. Interactive Letter Dragging:
o A set of letters, each with different colors and sizes, are randomly positioned on the
screen.
o Users can pick up and drag these letters around the screen by pinching them
(bringing the index finger and thumb together).
o The letters follow the user's finger movements, providing an interactive way to learn
and play with letters.
3. Visual Feedback:
o The application provides visual feedback by drawing circles on the tips of the index
finger and thumb, helping users see how their gestures are being tracked.
o Letters change position dynamically as they are dragged, giving a real-time
interactive experience.
4. Real-Time Processing:
o The application processes video frames in real-time, ensuring smooth and
responsive interaction.
o The webcam feed is continuously analyzed to update the positions of the letters
based on the user's hand gestures.

Final Project

Technical Details:
• OpenCV is used for capturing video from the webcam, processing the frames, and
displaying the output.
• MediaPipe handles hand detection and landmark extraction, allowing precise tracking of
hand gestures.
• PyAutoGUI is used to determine the screen dimensions, helping to map the webcam feed
coordinates to the actual screen size for accurate gesture recognition.

Use Cases:
• Educational Games: This application can be used in educational settings to teach children
about letters and words in a fun, interactive way.
• Interactive Learning Tools: It can be integrated into learning platforms to provide hands-on
experiences with digital content, enhancing engagement and retention.
